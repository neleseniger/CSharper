/*
* The four main basic types we we will work with in the beginning are:
* bool, Int, Float and String   
* bool or boolean, can only be 'true' or 'false'
* Int, or integer, is a whole number; 1, 2, 3
* Float is a decimal number; 3.14 or 7.777
* Strings is just text found between quotationmarks "This is a string, easy right?"
*
* Programmers use these different types to better communicate their thoughts and optimize the program
* C# have, at the time of writing; 10 different types of numbers, choosing the right ones can be key to your objective.
*
* There are many different data types which can be explored in the Microsoft C# documentation, see link below.
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types
